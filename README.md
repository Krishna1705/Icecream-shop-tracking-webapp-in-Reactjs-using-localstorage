This is basic Ice-cream Shop tracking Web application in React using localstorage.
Use can Add Shop location and it's detail by clicking on Add Location button on Home Page.
On add location Page User need to enter name,location of the shop and also need to add the various flavors offered by IceCream shop.
User can view the detail of individual Shop by clicking on the Card on the Home Page.

This project is a simple React web app (without any backend). I have made use of localstorage to save the shop data.
Have make use of React Router Version 6,React Hooks - useState(), useEffect(), useNavigate(), useLocation() etc. and have played with localstorage for shop details.
